# Robotic-Grasp-Pose-Estimation
Robotic Grasp Pose Estimation using stereovision and a Franka Emika Panda arm. This was a project in which we used neural networks and DAgger reinforcement learning to predict a point cloud of an object in front of a robotic arm. 

The ROS files and the bulk of the actual code is on the arm, but I share the resultant video, data training samples we acquired, and research paper here. The results, including the arm actuation, is shown in the video below.
